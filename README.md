**ML Projects Repository**
----------------------
*This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks showcasing various machine learning and data visualization techniques on different datasets.*

1. Titanic Dataset Analysis:
> Notebook: Titanic_Project.ipynb
 </br>This notebook analyzes the Titanic dataset by implementing a classificational models to predict the survival or death of individuals on the titanic.The notebook contains:
- Data Visualization: Perform visualizations to analyze passenger demographics, survival rates, and class distribution.
- Machine Learning Models: Build and evaluate machine learning models using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees to predict survival.
<br></br>

2. Cheese Dataset Analysis
> Notebook: Cheese_Project.ipynb
 </br>This notebook analyzes the Cheese dataset by implementing a regression model to predict the amount of calories in different types of cheese.The notebook contains:
- Data Visualization: Visualize characteristics of different components in cheese ( eg:'lipides', 'retinol', 'folates')
- Machine Learning Models: Develop and evaluate machine learning models using linear and polynomial regression to predict the amount of calories in different types of cheese.

3. Unsupervised Learning on Cheese Dataset
> Notebook: Unsupervised_Learning.ipynb
 </br>This notebook applies unsupervised learning techniques to the cheese dataset:
- Hierarchical Ascending Classification (HAC): Use HAC to group cheese varieties based on their features.
- K-Means Clustering: Implement K-Means clustering to identify distinct clusters within the cheese data.
